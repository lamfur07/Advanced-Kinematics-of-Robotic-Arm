# Advanced-Kinematics-of-Robotic-Arm
Design a 6-DOF spatial manipulator in SolidWorks. Translate the design files into MATLAB code through STL files. Then perform Forward and Inverse Kinematics along with other dynamics on the spatial manipulator using MATLAB.
This project consists of 3 phases: Initial, Intermediate and Final.
The designs during the phase of this project was constantly updated and improved so the breakdown of each iteration of design is provided with respectable phase.
